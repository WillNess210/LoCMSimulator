  Checking Build System
  CMake is re-running because C:/Users/WillN/Documents/Visual Studio 2017/LoCM/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
    the file 'C:/Users/WillN/Documents/Visual Studio 2017/LoCM/CMakeLists.txt'
    is newer than 'C:/Users/WillN/Documents/Visual Studio 2017/LoCM/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'
    result='-1'
  -- Found SFML 2.5.0 in C:/Program Files (x86)/SFML/lib/cmake/SFML
  CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
    No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as
  
      cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)
  
    should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower
    if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
    information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
